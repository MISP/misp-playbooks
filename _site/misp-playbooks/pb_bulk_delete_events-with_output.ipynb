The downside is that functions defined in this playbook need to be defined again in other playbooks, which is not optimal for code re-use. For this iteration of playbooks it is chosen to include the code in the playbook (more portability), but you can easily create one \"helper\" file that contains all the helper code and then import that file in each playbook (for example by adding to the previous cell `from helpers import *`). Note that the graphical workflow image is included as an external image. A missing image would not influence the further progress of the playbook."

Blocklisting an event prevents the event from being added again on the instance, for example if you synchronise with external communities or import events from external sources. It's also a feature often overlooked when setting up synchronised MISP servers. During the configuration phase it can confuse administrators that some events are added, and others are skipped for no apparent reason. As a rule of thumb, if you want to delete the event, and never receive an update again, then put it on the blocklist. If you are configuring and testing the synchronisation process then remove the event from the blocklist after deleting it. \n",
