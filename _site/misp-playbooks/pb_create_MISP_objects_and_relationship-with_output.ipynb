    "- Started from [issue 11](https://github.com/MISP/misp-playbooks/issues/11)\n",
    "- State: **published** : demo version with **output**\n",
    "- Purpose: This playbook walks the analyst through the phases of creating MISP objects and adding a relationship between these objects. \n",
    "- - The playbook is typically *triggered* when an an analyst wants to add related, contextually linked, attributes to a MISP event.\n",
    "- - The objects are added to a new or an existing MISP event. The playbook prints out a summary that can be used to notify colleagues via Mattermost or other channels.\n",
    "- - The playbook uses an Emotet sample to demonstrate the functionality, with links from a file object to URL and HTTP request objects. It also creates the victim objects.\n",
    "- Tags: [ \"objects\", \"context\" ]\n",
    "- Target audience: **SOC, CSIRT, CTI**\n",

The downside is that functions defined in this playbook need to be defined again in other playbooks, which is not optimal for code re-use. For this iteration of playbooks it is chosen to include the code in the playbook (more portability), but you can easily create one \"helper\" file that contains all the helper code and then import that file in each playbook (for example by adding to the previous cell `from helpers import *`). Note that the graphical workflow image is included as an external image. A missing image would not influence the further progress of the playbook.\n",

If you create a new event then its good practice to choose a self-explanatory **event title**. This event title is shown in the MISP event index and should provide you the necessary information what the event is about. You should avoid using generic event titles. Read the [Best Practices in Threat Intelligence](https://www.misp-project.org/best-practices-in-threat-intelligence.html) for further guidance.\n",

As a reminder, whereas *global* tags remain attached to the events that you share with your community, the *local* tags are not shared outside your organisation. It's also a good idea to primarily use tags that are part of a [taxonomy](https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies), this allows you to make the contexualisation more portable accross multiple MISP instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this playbook the list of tags is build via one of the helper functions `pb_get_misp_tags`. This function takes two arguments, first a list of tags to convert as *global* tags, and secondly a list of tags to convert as *local* tags. \n",

    "The default **TLP** for this event is **<span style='color:#FFBF00'>tlp:amber</span>**. The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) facilitates sharing of potentially sensitive information and allows for more effective collaboration. TLP is a set of four standard labels to indicate the sharing boundaries to be applied by the recipients. TLP is always set by the creator of information. You can find more information at [FIRST](https://www.first.org/tlp/). You can specify TLP via `event_tlp`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Despite the large list of available objects it’s always possible that they do not fully address your need. You can then choose to add a custom MISP object as a JSON file. This is document on the MISP project blog post [Creating a MISP object 101](https://www.misp-project.org/2021/03/17/MISP-Objects-101.html/) and in the MISP training slides for the [MISP Object Templates](https://www.misp-project.org/misp-training/3.3-misp-object-template.pdf). The advantage of adding new object types via a JSON file is that you can share them with the entire community via the GitHub repository (do a simple pull request) or share them directly with your partners in your MISP community.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases though maybe you just want to indicate the contextually relation between attributes via an attribute, without creating a full JSON definition of an object. MISP has a flexible way for you to do this rather quicky."
