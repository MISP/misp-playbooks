    "- Started from [issue 13](https://github.com/MISP/misp-playbooks/issues/13)\n",
    "- State: **Published**\n",
    "- Purpose: This playbook queries the enabled OSINT feeds and the local MISP events for matches with one or more **domain name(s)**. \n",
    "- - The playbook also queries URLscan for historical scans related to the domains and extracts the screenshots from URLscan. The playbook then uses the MISP modules to look up the DNS resolutions and queries VirusTotal, Shodan and URLhaus for information related to the domains. You can also specify additional entries (indicators or elements to be used for querying these sources). \n",
    "- - The playbook also looks up the known abuse contacts via abuse_finder. All this information is then included in a summary and send to Mattermost and TheHive.\n",

For this iteration of playbooks it is chosen to include the code in the playbook (more portability), but you can easily create one \"helper\" file that contains all the helper code and then import that file in each playbook (for example by adding to the previous cell `from helpers import *`).

You get the chance to override this default title but remember that it is good practice to choose a self-explanatory **event title**. This event title is shown in the MISP event index and should provide you the necessary information what the event is about. You should avoid using generic event titles.

As a reminder, whereas *global* tags remain attached to the events that you share with your community, the *local* tags are not shared outside your organisation. It's also a good idea to primarily use tags that are part of a [taxonomy](https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies), this allows you to make the contexualisation more portable accross multiple MISP instances.\n",

    "In this playbook the list of tags is build via one of the helper functions `pb_get_misp_tags`. This function takes two arguments, first a list of tags to convert as *global* tags, and secondly a list of tags to convert as *local* tags. It then returns a Python list of MISPTag objects.\n",
