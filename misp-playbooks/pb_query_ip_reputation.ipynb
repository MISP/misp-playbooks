The downside is that functions defined in this playbook need to be defined again in other playbooks, which is not optimal for code re-use. For this iteration of playbooks it is chosen to include the code in the playbook (more portability), but you can easily create one \"helper\" file that contains all the helper code and then import that file in each playbook (for example by adding to the previous cell `from helpers import *`). Note that the graphical workflow image is included as an external image. A missing image would not influence the further progress of the playbook."

You get the chance to override this default title but remember that it is good practice to choose a self-explanatory **event title**. This event title is shown in the MISP event index and should provide you the necessary information what the event is about. You should avoid using generic event titles.

As a reminder, whereas *global* tags remain attached to the events that you share with your community, the *local* tags are not shared outside your organisation. It's also a good idea to primarily use tags that are part of a [taxonomy](https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies), this allows you to make the contexualisation more portable accross multiple MISP instances.\n",
